# Prebuilt firmware artifacts

These files were extracted directly from the supplied `rodin_part` partition
dump. Update all of them together when changing the firmware base.

Do not mix these files with artifacts from another firmware release. The
system-compatible post-build step uses `vendor_ramdisk00` as an immutable
source. It removes only the stock-recovery programs, services, graphics, and
misplaced recovery HAL VINTF fragments that the type-2 OrangeFox fragment
replaces. The generated type-1 fragment retains the byte-identical stock
first-stage runtime, SELinux data, fstab, firmware, and all 244 stock modules
required by normal Android boot. Both generated fragments use LZ4. The supplied
kernel advertises zstd support, but a real-device zstd test failed before ADB
became available.

The retained type-1 platform fragment also supplies the stock
`android.hardware.boot-service.mtk_recovery` AIDL BootControl binary and its
VINTF fragment. OrangeFox replaces only its stock init rc with a recovery rc
that preloads `librodin_libcxx_compat.so`; this keeps `bootctl` on the stock
AIDL path instead of falling back to the legacy HIDL UFS boot-region code.

The default build profile is `cn`, which uses `vendor_ramdisk00`. Global
OS3.0.301.0.WOJMIXM must instead use `global/vendor_ramdisk00`; select it with
`RODIN_FIRMWARE_VARIANT=global`. The Global profile changes only the retained
type-1 platform fragment. Its DTB, fstab, init, SELinux data, and stock
recovery fragment were verified identical to the CN base, so the OrangeFox
recovery resources remain shared.

The textual device-tree patch deliberately does not embed the 29 MiB Global
fragment. Populate it from the matching full firmware package before using the
Global profile:

```bash
device/xiaomi/rodin/tools/import-global-firmware-inputs.sh \
  /path/to/rodin_global_images_OS3.0.301.0.WOJMIXM_16.0/images/vendor_boot.img
```

The importer accepts only the verified 64 MiB Global `vendor_boot.img` and
checks its hash, extracted type-1 fragment, and DTB before atomically replacing
`global/vendor_ramdisk00`.
